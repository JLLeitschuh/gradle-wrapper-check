## Project Goals

We aim to keep the scope of this project limited so that it is easy for maintainers to apply and forget about.

### Goals

To verify that all the gradle-wrapper.jar(s) in a given GitHub repository or pull request against that repo is an official Gradle Wrapper release.

### Non-Goals

It is not the goal of this action to verify that the gradle-wrapper.jar matches a specific version of Gradle,
nor that the version declared in the build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.properties file matches.
